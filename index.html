      <p class="col">A developer with a passion for software creation. I have been more of a hobbyist in the world
        of programming for nearly ten years and in the last three years, have begun to pursue a formal education in
        various programming languages and paradigms.

        I initially began honing my skills through graphic design works, primarily concerned with digital mediums.
        In doing so, I had become very knowledgeable and experienced using the Adobe suite of 2D raster and vector
        design products, namely Photoshop, Illustrator, and InDesign. I had also practiced 3D design in Maya and
        continue to hone those skills through Blender. After designing for a number of educational projects dealing
        with web design, I had begun to delve more into learning HTML5 and CSS in order to better understand the
        medium and taking a genuine interest in developing my programming skills beyond web front-end development.

        I had become familiar with C# from self-teaching, practiced and educated in C, C++, and Java
        through college educational programs, and have learned the underlying principles of the OOP paradigm through
        both formal education and my own research. I have had some exposure to Python during my own studies and am
        hoping to expand more on that language in the future. However, the OOP paradigm is not my only exposure to
        programming languages. Indeed, I am familiar with and have done some progarmming in a few other
        language paradigms, namely Scheme/Racket and Prolog.

        Whatever your own endeavors may seek to accomplish, I would love for the opportunity to participate in
        integrating computer technology and application software for your project, whether it be the entirety of
        your project's working pipeline or a small portion of it.
